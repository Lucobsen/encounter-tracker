# Combat Chronicle

An app created by Luke Jacobsen for tracking TTRPG combat encounters.

## Ideas

This app will;

1. Have a CRUD system for adding CREATURES to a combat encounter.
2. Track status effects effecting CREATURES.
3. Sort CREATURES based on INITATIVE.
4. The ability to HIDE CREATURES who are not yet in combat.
5. Track HP of CREATURES and mark them as DEAD when HP === 0.
